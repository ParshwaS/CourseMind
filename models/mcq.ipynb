      "Frames & Content Areas\n",
      "Content areas are simply the space your UML diagram occupies, and for the sake of organization it can be helpful to enclose that diagram in a frame. If you include a frame, you should also include a heading that describes the parameters of your model. Standard headings and their abbreviations are:\n",

      "Activity (act)\n",
      "Class\n",

      "Classes are represented with rectangles and can include varying amounts of data based on your diagram. Classifiers describe a set of objects that have a state and relationships to other objects. The type of classifier rectangle you’re using can have a keyword that distinguishes it as an interface, data type, stereotype, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objects\n",
      "If you are including a specific state and behavior within a class, you’ll want to make your diagram more specific, too. In this case, you’ll use an object — differentiated from a class rectangle simply by its underlined name.\n",
      "\n",
      "States\n",
      "To describe the states of a process or program, you’ll use circles indicating the initial and final states of your system. You can then describe states throughout your system by using rounded rectangles. In these rectangles, you can give the state a name and define its attributes and responses.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dependencies\n",
      "With a dotted line and an unclosed arrow, you can show that one element relies on another to get information. These relationships are important to note because changes can “break” your system.\n",
