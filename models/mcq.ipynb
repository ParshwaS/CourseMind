      "Frames & Content Areas\n",
      "Content areas are simply the space your UML diagram occupies, and for the sake of organization it can be helpful to enclose that diagram in a frame. If you include a frame, you should also include a heading that describes the parameters of your model. Standard headings and their abbreviations are:\n",

      "\n",
      "States\n",
      "To describe the states of a process or program, you’ll use circles indicating the initial and final states of your system. You can then describe states throughout your system by using rounded rectangles. In these rectangles, you can give the state a name and define its attributes and responses.\n",
